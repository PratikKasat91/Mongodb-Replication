Replica Set:
Instead of using standalone single mongod server, use multiple ones keeping copies of the same data using a Replica Set.

group of servers: one primary taking writes and multiple secondaries that keep copies of the primary's data.
if primary crashes, secondaries can elect a new primary from amongst themselves.

Setting up replica set:

rsconf = {
  _id: 'mongodrepl',
  members: [
  {_id: 0, host: 'mongod0:27017'}, 
  {_id: 1, host: 'mongod1:27017'},
  {_id: 2, host: 'mongodarb:27017'},
  ]
}
